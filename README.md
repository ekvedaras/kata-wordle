Lets build a game! Weâ€™ll be making [~Lingo~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB5uZolEEwM&) [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)!

The rules:
* The player has to guess the Wordle in six attempts or less
* Every word, which is entered should be in the (5 letter) word list
* If the letter is correct, the color will turn green
* If the letter is correct but placed wrong then it would turn yellow
* An incorrect letter turns gray
* Letters can be used more than one time

Its up to you if you make it tests only. Or if you create a UI or CLI interface.
